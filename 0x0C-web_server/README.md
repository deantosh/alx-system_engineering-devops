# Project Overview

Being a lazy software engineer is a great thing when you are a developer. Automating  tasks so that you don't have to rewrite the same commmands for repetitive tasks may sound lazy but it helps a developer save a lot of time especially when you are trying to configure tens or hundreds of servers.

This project focusses on creating scripts that automatically performs command to configure an Ubuntu machine to fit requirements (without human intervention).
