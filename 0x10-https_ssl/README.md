# Project Overview

HTTP is not a secure communication protocol since if a person is able to tap into the communication
challenge. All the data being sent between the client and the server is easily understood. This brings about
a security threat, especially when sensitive information i.e bank details is being transferred.

This leaves us with no choice than to try and secure the communication end points by encrypting/decrypting the
data being shared between the client and the server.

HTTP SSL is employed to achieve the above mentioned issue.

HTTPS SSL advantages:
1. Creating a more secure client-server connection.
2. Implementing HAproxy SSL termination.
3. Config HAproxy to redirect http traffic to https.
