# Project Overview

Project focuses on the conceptual theory regarding the underlying technology and architecture that facilitates the working of a websites. This involves designing different web infrastrucure designs with different requirements, to get an understanding of the hardware, transmission media and the softwares used when designing the web infrastructure.

For each design, an image containing all the components of the web infrastrucure must be designed on a whiteboard. This image would be followed by some specifics about the infrastructure. Lastly the issues associated with the design must also be explained.

This issues might include but is not limited to:

1. SPOF (Single Point Of Failure)
2. Security Issues (no firewalls and https)
3. Monitoring
