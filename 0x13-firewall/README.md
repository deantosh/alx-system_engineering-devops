# Project Overview

Project focusses on configuring firewall for the server. Firewall provides an extra layer of security by monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic. This is possible through a set of predetermined security rules that is enforced when the ufw is enabled.

For this project a host based firewall is used within the servers.
