#    -> Your Bash script should check if the file exists and print:
#       - if the file exists: school file exists
#       - if the file does not exist: school file does not exist
#    -> If the file exists, print:
#       - if the file is empty: school file is empty
#       - if the file is not empty: school file is not empty
#       - if the file is a regular file: school is a regular file
#       - if the file is not a regular file: (nothing)
