# Project Overview

This project focusses on the use of regular expressions when searching through data.
For this project, the regular expressions are build using Oniguruma, a regular expression
library which is used by Ruby by default.

Note:
Other regular expression libraries sometimes have different properties.

Because the focus of this project is to play with regular expressions (regex), a series of
tasks are provided to assist on this objective.
